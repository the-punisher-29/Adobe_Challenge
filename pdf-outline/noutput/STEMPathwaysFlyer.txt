STAK Parsippany -Troy Hills STEM Pathways

Mission Statement: To provide PTHSD high school students with the opportunity to
concentrate their studies, beyond those required in high school, in the areas of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics, and expose students to relevant real world
experiences through project work, conferences and presentations to enhance their high school
experience.

Goals:

* Inspire keen interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and
technology, develop strong scholarship in the subject and
promote the enjoyment of these studies in high school.

* Expose students to potential career opportunities in the field.

¢ Encourage students to pursue higher education and major in
STEM careers.

¢ Promote interactions with STEM professionals to learn about
future opportunities.

¢ Support field experiences connected to the world outside of
the school building.

¢ Signal to employers, universities, training programs, and
military that a student has completed a comprehensive course
of study in a specialized area.

* Cultivate transferable work habits such as perseverance, goal
setting, and self-direction.

What Colleges Say!

When asked the question, “Would participation in the
STEM Pathways set PTHSD students apart when applying
to your school?”, colleges responded with the following:

SUNY Binghamton: “Yes. We are a R1 research institution
and students with a strong STEM curriculum that includes
research or lab work are generally more competitive in our
applicant pool and more success as students at
Binghamton because of their early HS experience.”

Towson University: “Participation in this program would
show us that the student is challenging him/herself in their
courses which is something we look at when reviewing
applications.”

Drew University: “Yes, it would show that they are
challenging themselves in the classroom.”

NJIT: “Yes- this would demonstrate to Admissions that a
student is interested in STEM programs, and would be a
strong candidate for our programs.”

Ithaca College: “Yes, we look for students who participate
in classes and activities that enhance their knowledge and
skills in their area of interest.”

Montclair University: “Rigorous math and science lab
classes beyond standard curriculum could be looked at for
scholarship eligibility along with high GPA.”
